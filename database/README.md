# Database

Provide a file for database import with prepared mock data for:
* users
* folders
* notes

Database structure can be created by using one of the following methods:
* Using migrations and running:  <em><strong> php artisan migrate </em></strong>
* Using the sql in the databaseStructure.sql file in this directory

Sql for importing test data is located in the testData.sql file. This part could also be done by
using seeders/factories in laravel, but I decided to just create my own data manually because I think it is more representive than dummy data generated by other tools.
